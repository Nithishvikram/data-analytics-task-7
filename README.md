# data-analytics-task-7


The task involves creating a small SQLite database file named sales_data.db containing a single sales table. A Python script or Jupyter Notebook is used to connect to this database, run one or two SQL queries to retrieve data, and display the results. The SQL query should group sales by product, calculating the total quantity sold and revenue generated. The data is then loaded into a pandas DataFrame, printed, and visualized using a basic bar chart that shows the revenue for each product. The chart can optionally be saved as an image file. The key libraries to be used include sqlite3, pandas, and matplotlib. The steps involve connecting to the database, executing a query, and using pandas and matplotlib to display and visualize the output.
